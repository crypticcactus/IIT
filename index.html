					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My interest in IT developed as most, at a young age, growing up watching the world and technology evolve, playing on many different machines and consoles. Ive always been in awe just how computers function after being built and just what they are capable of. After my attempt at university for Game Art and Animation, which financially wasnt viable at the time, for the time that I was there, working along side some of the programmers I began to fall in love with the idea of coding, the behind the scenes of how everything works, and just how it could be manipulated and implemented to do so many things. Over the past few years I have dabbled, watched and researched many areas of coding, computing and gaming purely as a hobby until deciding to take the next step and create a future for myself, something to work towards. Something I can grow in as a person, challenge myself and always be on the prowl to gain information and learn new things as the world continues to develop new things on the daily. 
					I chose RMIT mainly due the availability of online learning, but also due to hearing many great things through those that have attended, both family and friends.
					During my studies I would like to gain more knowledge on the very broad topic of information technology, so I can understand a lot my topics than I currently do, but my main goal is to walk away with enough skills to pursue the Cyber Security field. </p>

					<h2>Senior Incident Response</h2>

					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>To begin with I am still unsure on where I would like to end up and this will most likely change over time and as I become familiar with more technical knowledge during my Bachelors degree. I spent a good amount of time browsing seek, indeed and google, reading different parts of Cyber Security and there are so many directions than I first anticipated.

					I stumbled across this ad on seek for a Cyber Incident Response Specialist, read through the add, and whilst very under qualified at present, found myself intrigued at the idea of incident response within Cyber Security. I actually went on to do a little more research and watched a few things online in regards to incidence response and could somewhat picture myself doing this. This role in particular is for a senior incident responder that works closely with clients to ensure that they are prepared for any security threats that may arise and also assists in being able to protect during an attack and analyse afterwards to implement new strategies and protocols to prevent it happening again. This appeals to me because I believe that privacy, and information within a business is crucial in being kept safe and out of the hands of those who should not have access to it, attackers. Without security measures and people working around the clock to protect this, the type of information that could be obtained could have astronomical effects in the downfall of a business, people within it and even those that have had their information stored. Its not okay for someone to come along and try to destroy this without a second thought on the repercussions that could follow.</p>
					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>At present, other than general knowledge of computers, networking and programming I currently dont have any of the needed skills, qualifications or experience. I guess thats why it also appeals to me because I need to challenge myself and get a lot of the needed requirements on the way.</p>
					<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
					<p>For this position there is a lot of requirements and criteria that needs to be met as it should being such a high end role with a lot on the line at times. It requires a vast array of knowledge across networking and infrastructure, as well as being able to have skills in analytical problem solving, penetration testing and red teaming (the attack team). A Minimum 5 years experience in a security industry ideally leading cyber incident response engagements is also desired and an ability to travel as this role, as many others in the field could see you end up in different states or even countries. 
					This add doesnt list in particular qualifications needed but I would imagine having a degree in I.T, Cyber Security or even Data science would be a start as would having certificates in CEH, CompTIA Security and even CISSP. </p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>My plan, which I knew going into this was is based around a 7 year plan.
					First and foremost the completion of my degree in Information Technology, leaning towards security, networking and programming where ever possible. 
					Along the way I am hoping to enter the field of I.T which I have no current experience in by landing a job even in customer service to begin with. Work here for as long as I can, even a few years really and from there look to gain some practical hands on before moving into a Network administrator or systems administrator role.
					Along the way I will also look to work on side projects in my own time as well as gaining some extra qualifications in CEH and CompTia which will be beneficial in furthering my career. 
					After this, and a few years, possible 3 or so then I will look to get into a Cyber Security role, and again work here obtaining new skills, hands on practice and more experience to eventually one day within the next 7 years land a role as a senior incident responder. </p>

				 <h1>Personality Profile</h1>

					<h2>Results for My Online Tests</h2>
					<p>After taking the Myers-Briggs test I end up being an Assertive Defender and for this it gives me a clearer understanding behind the individual I am. Upon reading through the personality traits I found myself reading descriptions that I would use if I were to describe myself. I generally see myself as an introvert who whilst in the shadows is very observant of everything that its happening around me. I am very judgemental of things and need to have things planned out and followed in order to maintain happiness for myself. Whilst being introverted I do strongly believe in my abilities and decisions that I feel I have a good understanding of and am generally on the fence when it comes to making decisions. Depending on the situation I will either think or let me feelings control the outcome. In regards to my learning style I am very visual base which is why at times I feel it hard to get anything out of the collaborate sessions that I attend weekly. The approach I need to take is a listen, look and note down anything of importance as the lecture or tutorial takes place just to stay on track and not get distracted. Lastly I wanted to take another personality test just to give myself more information behind the person I am. The last test, was good for myself to see as after the results were shown it actually listed based off my responses to the visual questions asked, a list of suggested occupations. Whilst the middle one has absolutely nothing to do with where I want to head in life I can see why it popped up due to the nature of investigative skills and maintain records. The other 2 results how ever were both computer and I.T based which was good to see as this is where I am looking to steer my life towards. Although not directly related to my end goal it was good to see some reassurance that my personality could be ideal for job types that are similar to those of software testers and analysts. 

					In a team environment the hardest part for me I believe is going to be stepping out of my shell and continuing to learn and discuss in a auditory manner.  I am one who is introverted at the best of times and prefers to see things as they are and have things in front of me. In a team environment I am going to find it hard contribute at first and discuss ideas freely as I much prefer to work solo and have a clear set of steps to ensure I can work towards my final goal. Having these results means ill be able to work on my behaviour in a social environment and look to create more chances for interaction and discussion than I would of done in the past as well as continue to improve on the idea of auditory learning. Once comfortable with my team members and communication is open ill be able to discuss the idea of my learning style and hopefully with the other members implement that into our work as well as any other styles my team will have.

					When forming a team I need to take into account first and foremost, the team part. There will be multiple people with different personality styles and I think it would be good idea to open up (for those who wont too) a discussion and share our results so we are better able to understand one and other as we continue to work together on the next assignment and possibly the one after that. Working on that and each individuals strengths will help to ensure a smooth and healthy work environment.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>The Mekanik is a mobile phone application that will be both available across iPhone and Android that allows users to search a data base built around all makes and models of cars and list a variety of information. This information will range from oil grades to engine capacities and even common issues on any searched vehicle, allowing the average joe, an apprentice or even a qualified mechanic to have a world of resources available at their fingertips. The data base will be built off of all current known car knowledge and information readily available across the internet (forums, videos, manufactures sites ect) and will have the ability to grow and develop at later stages through user input and verification.<p>
				<article>
				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>This application will be useful to even the most inexperience car person as well as those that are qualified with years of experience. It allows the user to search the app for anything that relates to all car make and models, then from there branches off into multiple sub categories. This could be something as simple as tyre pressure, oil grade for your car or even something more experienced such as changing the transmission fluid. What stands out about this app is its ability to have everything that one would need to know about any car make and model, viewed in simplicity and on their smart device. Removing the need for countless hours of forum surfing, lengthy videos or information that only qualified mechanics know can be readily available and accessed by anyone who downloads the app. At present I was unable to find any app of similar function making this a project that could prove very useful to millions of people.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
					<p>Mekanik will feature a simple designed UI that from the get go allows users to navigate with ease to their desired end search result what ever that may be. Upon downloading the app and opening it for the first time users will be prompted to enter their age as well as their experience within the mechanic scene allowing us to gather information and use data analysis to help develop an app that is able to meet the requirements of the users.
					The home screen will feature a Basic UI with the home screen having a few quick links to common search results that are more likely going to be searched. Things like oil grades, oil changes, tyre pressure and even jump starting a car. There will be a search function button on the home screen that upon input will move to a new screen where there will be a list of categories that can be filled in to reach the desired search result. The user will be able to search based off as little or as much as they want and have the ability to create their own search through the use of keywords if they know exactly what they are looking for. 
					On this page we expect to have Model, Make, Year and Keywords. This will cover every make and model that is known to exist. So whether it be information on a 2009 Ford Falcon FG or a 1967 Chevy Impala hardtop powered by a 502-cubic-inch big-block, you can find it. From the users input it will then bring up another page with a list of sub categories from which the user can now begin to navigate to a finer search result. This page will contain such things as Transmission, Engine, Fuel Type, Oil, Induction/Turbo, Colour ect. Clicking on any of these will then bring up the last of the sub categories before providing the user with all information in regards to the topic. For example clicking on Oil will bring up a summary of oil related information -  oil type, oil grade, oil consumption ect and scrolling down will display variety of articles and videos on the topic of oil which have all been gathered and implemented into our database. A Few simple clicks and the user will have access to things that may have taken them a ages to find online depending on the complexity of the task.
					A navigation bar on the left hand side will slide across and give the ability for a user to sign in/join (completely optional), and will allow those that have to save searches and customise their home screen to feature information they find relatable and use on a regular basis. There will also be a Home button that will take the user back to their home screen as well as notifications for any topic that has been saved. This will range from new information, to changes on existing information and anything else that correlates to that said saved search result. 
 
					In later versions we expect to add a report feature for broken links, wrong data or otherwise not listed information which at this stage will be a function on the home screen, but could easily be something that is accessible even when the user is a few searches in. As as we continue to tweak, modify and update The Mekanik, users will be allowed to submit information across any car or topic (pending cross checking and data verification) giving the application the ability to grow and develop as more information becomes available. Our intended end goal is to have an application that contains all possible information that any one individual could need, and have so in the palm of their hand.

					The database will be built by information that is available online, be it forums, manufactures websites or even car sales and then finally by working with mechanics on the more complex and detailed tasks.</p>

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>For creating Android Apps one can use Java or Kotlin as programming languages and Android Studio or Eclipse can be used as IDEs. For creating iOS Apps, Swift or Objective C programming language can be used to develop apps and the IDE that will be used is Xcode. There are also readily available app development platforms such as AppSheet, Appery.io and even iBuildApp that can be used to develop Mekanik. 
					Hardware requirements will be either a laptop or desktop that has the following minimum specs to be able to run any of the above software tools. 
					<ul class="Minimum Spec requirements">
					<li>Windows 7/8/10 or Mac OS X 10.10 or higher</li>
					<li>4 GB ram minimum â€“ 8GB is preffered but 4GB will do the job</li>
					<li>i5 or i7 Processor</li>
					<li>2GB of available disk mimimum, 4 GB recommended</li>
					<li>256 SSD â€“ 512 SSD would be even better. HDD are also viable, SSD are faster and use less energy</li>
					<li>1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution</li>

					Having an Android phone and Apple phone would also be great to be able to test the application as it is developed.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>Skills required to develop an app across both platforms would be mobile user interface design, cross-platform app development, back-end computing and a modern programming language such as Java/C#. It is pretty common and feasible to be able to find the skills required, if not to be able to learn them for simple app development is definitely an option. Obtaining the required hardware needed will be most computers and desktops provided they are within a reasonable release date year. Having a device to test as development comes into play wont be an issue as most if not all people use smart phone devices in 2020. All of the software needed can be found online with a simple search and then downloaded as needed. </p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>If Mekanic is successful, there will have been an application developed that has all known information in regards to cars readily available without the need to open any browser. The original problem of information being tucked away into hours of searches, endless scrolling or only in the minds of those qualified will not be an issue anymore. This development will have significant impact on those new to cars, being able to look up information on the go, or if they come into trouble with anything, as well as for those who are qualified. For those qualified, and especially those who only specialise on certain makes and models, having information about other makes and models, known issues and common issues will be a game changer allowing them to tackle any challenge, or car that may come there way. This development will also be great for newly released cars and have information added as it becomes available giving those that have never worked on or looked into the new cars the option too.</p>
